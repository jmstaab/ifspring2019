    <li>Jacob Staab, Mechanical Engineering / Marketing, Senior</li>
    <li>I'm interested in working in a space where I can utilize skills across wide ranging disciplines (design, business, engineering etc) in order to solve problems due to inefficiencies of cross-discipline work within an organization.</li>
    <li>I have a bit of experience with HTML, CSS, and JS, but I'm entirely self-taught and wish to gain a better understanding of the fundamentals before I move on to higher level integrations. I've had some work experience in which I've built webpages, but have often been bound by working within environments like Wordpress, Shopify, and Hubspot with the stipulation to make my code easily editable by others within the companies without a background in front-end. </li>
    <li>I hope to develop a more fundamental understanding of front-end languages as I only know about aspects which I've needed to use.</li>
    <li>Designing for a screen differs from that of paper as screen canvas dimensions and ratios need to be dynamic to support a wide range of devices.</li>
    <li><a href="https://asana.com/" target="_blank">Asana's website</a> demonstrates effective design in the site's fluid use of breakpoints as well as an appropriate and consistent design language throughout.</li>
    <li>I believe that <a href="https://privacy.com/" target="_blank">Privacy's</a> website demonstrates clear and concise communication of their product features and uses through an elegant "story-like" portrayal that's to the point and doesn't include unnecessary styling.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com." target="_blank">YouTube's website</a> is a very well optimized site through the use of lazy loading thumbnails, cache storage of most styling elements, and consolidated stylesheets and element tags of their various pages. This efficiency allows a platform delivering large-format content like YouTube to run as smoothly as possible.</li>
